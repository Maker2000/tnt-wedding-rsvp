            classmate of mine. It was when I mentioned something related to my old high school that she didn't relate to that I realized she wasn't the person I
            thought she was. We continued talking because, to me, I had made a new friend. It wasn't until a few months into knowing and talking to her that I
            fell for her. I was smitten by her beauty, her intelligence, and her kindness. I knew she was the one for me, and I started a long 8-month pursuit
            for her. She eventually agreed to be my person, and the rest is history.

                If you've ever wondered what happens when a Facebook message turns into forever, here is the story. The real story. It started in July 2015 when
                I got a message from someone named Terrence Signature Band Matthews (Yes, that was his real Facebook name üôÑ). Come on, was I being approached
                by a full gospel fusion band?
              </div>
              <div className="italic">
                His opening line? ‚ÄúHello‚Äù
                <br />
                No context, no follow-up, just ‚Äúhello.‚Äù
                <br />
                We started chatting. Easy, normal conversation. I assumed he knew who I was. I mean, he messaged me, right? Besides, I knew who he was. Then
                September, just two months after us talking, he drops ‚Äúyou're a former Knoxite after all.‚Äù
              </div>
              <div>
                Except, I wasn't. I never went to Knox. That's when I realized this man had no idea who I actually was. He had mistaken me for someone else the
                whole time, while I was here thinking we shared a past.
                <br />
                It didn't matter. By then, we were already vibing. He was sweet, funny, and OBVIOUSLY smitten. He couldn‚Äôt back out even if he tried. Then came
                March 2016. The official beginning of the pursuit. That's when he stepped up. He was intentional, consistent, and real. He showed me exactly who
                he was.
                <br />
                Eight months later, I said yes to being his girlfriend.
                <br />
                And now I'm saying yes to being his wife.
                <br />
                So no, I didn't go to that school, but I'm graduating into forever with him now.

          It's been an absolute pleasure knowing Rochelle. She is the love of my life, that I'm confident about. I love her to bits, and now that we are getting

          From the beginning, loving Terrence has felt natural, grounding, and full of joy. He is the love of my life, the calm to my storm, and the laughter in
          my soul. As we prepare to step into marriage, my heart is full. I'm confident in our friendship, and our future. I love him without hesitation. I
          can't wait for us to build an incredible life together.
